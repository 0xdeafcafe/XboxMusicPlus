XboxMusicPlus
=============

A little [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/xbox-music-%20/hjgekhihcpjofeakeimnegohbpeegddf "Chrome Extension") for [Xbox Music](http://music.xbox.com/ "Xbox Music").

Xbox Music on the Web is great, but it's still missing a few features. This adds those features.

Current Features are:
 - Add Entire Collection to Now Playing
 - Shuffling the content currently playing


Also, big thanks to James Billingham for figuing out the way xbox music's Javascript works.
